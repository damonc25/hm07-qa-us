# Sprint 7 project

Project Name: API Testing of Urban Grocers App

Description: What this project consisted of was testing various API requests using different request methods, (e.g., GET for retrieving data, POST for submitting data, PUT for updating data, DELETE for deleting data), using JavaScript coding. My goal was to test and see what was the specific status code response from the server to each individual request method was assigned from the URL, response body and Endpoint that was provided. After sending the API request, the server processesed it and sent it back with a response. This response included whether it passed or failed. If the response failed, I then tested the request body that was provided and attempted to locate mistakes, if any, fix the bug that caused the error.
